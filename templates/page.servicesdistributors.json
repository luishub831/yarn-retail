DTG is perfect for limited-edition merch, one-o\u001c events, small teams, or personalised prints with names and numbers.

With DTF, we print a transfer that is then heat-applied to the item. This works well on a wide range of fabrics and is great for small<br/>logos, left chest prints, names and numbers, and branding across mixed orders where not every<br/>garment is the same.<br/><br/>For you, this means we can keep your logo looking consistent across T-shirts, hoodies, some outerwear<br/>and other items that might be di\u001dcult to run in the same traditional print setup. It’s also a practical<br/>solution when you expect ongoing top-up orders in small quantities, because we can produce transfers<br/>that allow for e\u001dcient, repeatable decoration without starting from scratch each time.</p>"
